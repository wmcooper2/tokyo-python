A website for Python in Tokyo.

## Purpose/Goal

Serves as a place for me to keep an abridged collection of notes on the official documentation. Also will act as a kind of bulletin board for Python related events in the Tokyo area. This is an ongoing side project with no real deadline.

## Tech/Libraries Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

## Problems/Solutions

- Using nested routing took a little reading in the documentation to figure out, but I got the top navlinks to act as the main routes and the sub-navlinks on the left to change and control what page is shown in the main area.
