        Here we make comparisons between python and other languages. It's mostly
        syntactic/idiomatic differences because it is not our aim to say one
        language is better than another. This is intended to help anyone branch
        out to different languages by comparing them to python which I hope will
        facilitate learning. I know from personal experience that it is easy to
        give up on something good when you get lost easily through the confusion
        of some language's syntax. The reason I like python so much is because
        it feels more like native English than the other languages I tried to
        learn when I started programming. Python really got me into programming
        and helped me wrap my head around the larger concepts without confusing
        me with extra syntax. Later, I was ready to take on those other
        languages.
