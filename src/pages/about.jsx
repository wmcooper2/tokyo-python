      <p>
        Tokyo Python is a site for the Python language. It provides condensed
        snippets of documentation (with links to the original) like cheat sheets
        and syntax comparisons with other programming languages. I'm making an
        extra effort with regular expressions because I really enjoy them. This site is a constant work in progress and looks best in Chrome, so... yeah.
